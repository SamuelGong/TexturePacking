# 1. OVERVIEW
*TexturePacking*, as its name reveals, is a program that attempt to solve
the **texture packing problem** in three different **approximate algorithm**.
As a homework assigned in the **advanced data structure and algorithm analysis** course for sophomore majoring in CS,
it is an **teamwork project** for **non-comercial** purposes.
